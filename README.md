# JediMammothModules


**Welcome to the jedimammoth wiki!** <br>

JediMammoth acts as a C2 modular implant control system. This system functions most efficiently when integrated into a fully distributed network architecture, requiring a full operational network. The application provides automated and interactive agents that beacon out from target networks. This tool is designed for, but is not exclusive to, network penetration testing organizations. All liability of this tool is on the part of the application owner at the time of use.

**Modules** <br>
The included modules are importable sections of a larger agent. Therefore not all modules can be run as is. They must be altered to be used as a standalone tool. <br>

If you are unable to alter the modules, this toolset is probably not for you.
